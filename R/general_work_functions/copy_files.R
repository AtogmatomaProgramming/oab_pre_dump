#' Copy folder and contents

#' @description
#' Function that makes a copy of all the files and subdirectories from a source folder to a destination folder.
#' If files already exist in the destination folder, the user is prompted to decide whether to overwrite them or not.
#'
#' @param folder_from Character. Path to the source directory containing the files and folders to be copied.
#' @param folder_to Character. Path to the destination directory where files and folders will be copied
#'
#' @return NULL. The function is called for its side effects of copying files.
